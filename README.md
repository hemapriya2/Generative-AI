Overview
This repository contains code for implementing an autoencoder model specifically designed for processing paragraphs. Autoencoders are a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning, particularly for dimensionality reduction and feature learning. In this context, the autoencoder aims to compress the information within a paragraph into a lower-dimensional representation, and then reconstruct the original paragraph from this compressed representation.

How it Works
The autoencoder model consists of two main components: an encoder and a decoder.

Encoder
The encoder takes the input paragraph and compresses it into a lower-dimensional latent space representation. This is typically achieved through a series of dense layers or recurrent layers (such as LSTM or GRU). The latent space representation captures the essential features of the paragraph.

Decoder
The decoder takes the latent space representation generated by the encoder and reconstructs the original paragraph from it. This is done by decoding the latent representation back into the original input space, effectively reversing the compression process performed by the encoder.

Training
The model is trained using paragraphs from a corpus of text data. The objective is to minimize the reconstruction error between the original input paragraphs and the paragraphs reconstructed by the decoder. This is typically done using gradient-based optimization techniques such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam.

Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow (or any other deep learning framework)
NumPy
Pandas (for data preprocessing, if applicable)
Usage
Data Preparation: Prepare a dataset of paragraphs for training the autoencoder. This could be a collection of text documents or any other source of paragraphs.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the data as necessary, such as tokenization, padding, and converting text to numerical representations.

Model Training: Train the autoencoder model using the preprocessed data. Tune hyperparameters such as the number of layers, hidden units, and learning rate as needed.

Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on a separate validation set to assess its performance. Metrics such as reconstruction loss or semantic similarity can be used for evaluation.

Inference: Use the trained model for reconstructing paragraphs or generating new paragraphs from latent space representations.
